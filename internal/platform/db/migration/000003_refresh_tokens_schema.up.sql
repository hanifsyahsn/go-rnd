-- refresh_tokens makes refresh tokens rotating and revocable. Every refresh
-- token's jti is one row. A login starts a family; each refresh revokes the
-- presented token (replaced_by = its successor) and issues the next one in the
-- same family. Presenting an already-rotated token again means it leaked, so
-- the whole family is revoked. Logout revokes the family too.
--
-- session_expires_at caps a login's lifetime. An untrusted device's login gets
-- one (login + UNTRUSTED_SESSION_DURATION), copied to every successor, and no
-- refresh token outlives it. NULL is a trusted device: refresh tokens keep
-- sliding with no cap.
