# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

`go-rnd` is an R&D base: a Go 1.26 HTTP API (Gin + Postgres) organised as vertical feature slices, kept
deliberately free of features so the user can practise hard backend topics on it by hand. It is **fully
JSON:API 1.1** on both sides — see *JSON:API*. The only slices are local auth
(bcrypt passwords + ES256 JWTs with rotating refresh tokens) and `me`, so experiments have a `users` table and
an authenticated caller to build on. `docs/API.md` is the client-facing endpoint reference (with `curl`
examples) — update it when an endpoint changes.

## R&D mode — read this first

The user writes code with AI all day and only reviews it; this repo is where they rebuild the hands-on skill:
worker pools, async processing, Go locking and concurrency, Postgres locking (`FOR UPDATE`, `SKIP LOCKED`,
advisory locks), the transactional outbox, idempotency, orchestration / sagas, and anything else at that level.

**Claude is the guide, not the author.** The user writes the core of every experiment.

- **Core** (the user writes it; Claude doesn't): the mechanism the experiment is about and the tests that prove
  it. That means worker loops and pools, lock acquisition and release, claim / relay / retry / backoff logic,
  saga steps and compensations, idempotency handling, the schema design behind them, and the concurrency tests
  that show it works. If unsure whether something is core, treat it as core.
- **Plumbing** (Claude may do it when asked): Makefile / docker-compose (adding Redis, NATS, ...), config fields,
  wiring into `main.go` / the router once the design exists, `mockgen` / `sqlc` runs, docs.
- **How to guide:** state the problem, its constraints and the acceptance criteria, including a test that would
  *fail* on a wrong implementation (concurrent goroutines against real Postgres, `go test -race`). Answer with a
  question or a hint first; escalate to pseudo-code, and give real code only when the user explicitly asks.
- **How to review:** hard and specific, like a senior reviewer. Look for data races, goroutine leaks, lock ordering
  and deadlocks, a ctx that isn't propagated or a shutdown that doesn't drain, transaction boundaries, a crash
  between two steps, non-idempotent retries, unbounded queues or memory, and tests that can't fail. Cite
  `file:line`. Say what's good too, briefly.
- Where long-running components (workers, relays) live and how they join the server's lifecycle is the user's
  call. It's part of the first experiment that needs it. Once it's decided, record the convention here.

Experiment ideas, roughly by difficulty (each grounded in this codebase):

1. Background worker: prune expired `refresh_tokens` on a ticker, delete in batches, stop on shutdown; then only
   one replica runs it (`pg_try_advisory_lock` — and why a pooled `*sql.DB` makes that tricky).
2. In-memory rate limiter for login (token bucket per key, `sync.Mutex` vs `sync.Map`, eviction goroutine,
   `-race`, benchmarks); `singleflight` for concurrent refreshes vs the current `reuseGrace` approach.
3. Transactional outbox: events written in the same tx as the change, a relay claiming rows with
   `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, at-least-once delivery, idempotent consumers, retries with backoff + jitter,
   dead-lettering, per-aggregate ordering.
4. Async jobs as a JSON:API resource (`202 Accepted` + a `jobs` resource to poll), a bounded worker pool with
   backpressure (`503` + `Retry-After` when full), per-job timeouts, panic isolation, drain on shutdown.
5. `Idempotency-Key` on a `POST`: two identical concurrent requests → one execution, same response.
6. Saga: a multi-step flow (e.g. account deletion) with persisted step state, retryable steps and compensation;
   orchestration vs choreography over the outbox from 3.

## Commands

Tooling on PATH: `go`, `sqlc`, `migrate` (golang-migrate CLI), `mockgen` (github.com/golang/mock), `openssl`,
and a running Docker engine for integration tests (testcontainers). `make` reads `.env` and exports it.

```sh
make run                       # go run cmd/api/main.go
docker compose up -d postgres  # local Postgres on DB_LOCAL_PORT
make migrate_up                # or migrate_up1 / migrate_down / migrate_down1 / migrate_dirty SEQ=<n>
make migrate_create NAME=add_something
make sqlc                      # regenerate every */sqlc package
make mock SOURCE=path/file.go DESTINATION=path/mock_file.go PKG_NAME=pkg
make ec_private && make ec_public
./build.sh && ./deploy.sh      # image go_rnd_api:$(cat VERSION); deploy = graceful SIGTERM swap

go test ./... -short           # unit tests only (no Docker)
go test ./...                  # full suite; TestMain starts a migrated postgres:17 container per package
go test -run '^TestService_Refresh_I$' ./internal/features/auth/refresh -count=1
go test -race ./...            # the race detector; use it on every concurrency experiment

make test / test_short / test_coverage                                   # -count=1 variants of the above
make test_only TEST=TestService_Refresh_I PACKAGE=./internal/features/auth/refresh
make test_package PACKAGE=./internal/features/auth/refresh
```

On Windows the Makefile sets `DOCKER_HOST=npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine` for the test targets. Set it yourself for a plain
`go test ./...` — without it testcontainers' auto-detection intermittently fails with "rootless Docker is not supported on
Windows".

## Architecture

### Package layout

- `cmd/api` — entrypoint: config → db pool → validators → token maker → one service/handler per slice →
  `server.Handlers` → `server.NewServer(...).Run(ctx)` (graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM).
- `internal/platform` — infrastructure: `config` (viper, `.env` optional), `logging` (`log/slog` setup: `New` /
  `Setup` / `Check` / `Fatal`, a handler adding `request_id`), `server` (`server.go` + `router.go` with the
  `Handlers` struct), `middleware` (`RequestID`, `AccessLog`, `JSONAPIMediaType`, `AccessTokenMiddleware`,
  `RequireRole`, its own sqlc for `GetUserIsActive`), `jwttoken` (ES256), `db/tx` (generic transaction helper),
  `db/migration`, `constant`.
- `internal/shared` — cross-cutting: `apperror` (typed error → HTTP status, with a JSON:API `Source`),
  `jsonapi` (documents, serializer, sparse fieldsets, links, error objects, `?include` policy, the query
  parser), `handlerutil` (`ParseQuery` / `BindResource` / `ParamID` / `WriteData` / `WriteMeta` /
  `WriteError`), `validation` (`notblank`, `rfc3339`, `RegisterGinValidators`), `pagination`, `password`
  (bcrypt), `enum` (`Role`: `user` / `admin`), `requestid` (`Header`, `Key`, `With` / `FromContext` / `Detach`),
  `requestuser` (the authenticated caller on the request context: `With` / `FromContext`),
  `dto`, `constant` (context keys, cookie names), `utility` (`SafeGo` / `SafeGoContext`, …), `testhelper`.
- `internal/features/<domain>/<action>` — the vertical slices: `auth/{register,login,refresh,logout}`, `me`.
  `<domain>/shared` holds what more than one slice of that domain needs (`auth/shared`: cookies, reading the
  refresh token off a request, response shapes, and the `refresh_tokens` insert / family-revoke queries).

### Slice structure

```
route.go        Route(rg *gin.RouterGroup, h H)   registers the endpoint(s)
handler.go      H interface + handler             ParseQuery → BindResource → service → WriteData
service.go      S interface + service             business logic; returns *apperror.AppError
store.go        StoreI + Store + Querier          only when the slice writes in a transaction
dto.go          QuerySpec, Request, Resource      Request = the document's attributes, gin binding +
                                                  `label` tags (shown in 422 details)
query/*.sql     sqlc queries                      the slice's own; sqlc/ is generated
mock_*.go       mockgen output                    MockH, MockS, MockStoreI + MockQuerier
main_test.go    TestMain → testhelper.RunWithDB
*_unit_test.go / *_integration_test.go
```

Rules:
- **One slice = one action** (or one small resource's CRUD). A flow that isn't the slice's
  own action gets its own slice.
- **A query needed by two slices goes in `<domain>/shared/query`, never copied into both.** A slice whose
  reads are all shared has no sqlc block.
- A slice that writes in a transaction declares `Querier interface { sqlc.Querier; sharedsqlc.Querier }` in
  `store.go`; `RunInTx` binds both to one `*sql.Tx` (`txQueries` embeds both, the shared one under the alias
  `sharedQuerier`). `mockgen -source=store.go` emits `MockStoreI` + `MockQuerier`; unit tests make
  `RunInTx` call `fn(mockQuerier)`. `auth/refresh` is the worked example (`store.go`, `service_unit_test.go`).
- Lock before you write: `auth/refresh` locks the presented token's row (`FOR UPDATE`) inside the tx before it
  rotates it.
- Not-yours reads as not-found: another user's resource is a 404 with the same message as a missing one.

### Adding a slice (checklist)

1. Migration (`make migrate_create NAME=...`) if the schema changes.
2. `query/queries.sql` + a block in `sqlc.yaml` (copy one) → `make sqlc` → `mockgen` the `sqlc/querier.go`.
3. `dto.go`, `service.go`, `handler.go`, `route.go` (+ `store.go` for a transaction) → `mockgen` them.
4. Add the handler to `server.Handlers`, one `Route` call in `NewRouter` (public / authed group; for
   admin-only routes add `api.Group("/admin")` with `AccessTokenMiddleware` + `RequireRole(enum.RoleAdmin)`), wire
   it in `cmd/api/main.go`, and a case in `server/router_unit_test.go`.
5. Tests: handler unit (MockS), service unit (MockQuerier / MockStoreI), service integration (real Postgres).

### Request flow

0. Every route (404 / 405 / panic included) runs `RequestID` → `AccessLog` → recovery. `RequestID` keeps an
   incoming `X-Request-ID` matching `^[A-Za-z0-9._:-]{1,128}$`, else makes a UUID, and sets it on the response
   header (before the handlers), in the gin context (`requestid.Key`) and in the request context. `AccessLog`
   writes one `request` record (method, path, status, latency_ms, client_ip, bytes; `user_id` comes from the
   handler once auth has put the caller on the request context): warn with `cancelled=true` when the client went away (request context cancelled), else error
   for a 5xx, info for the rest.
1. `middleware.JSONAPIMediaType` (every `/api` route) checks content negotiation first (406 / 415).
2. `AccessTokenMiddleware` reads the access token from the `app-access-token` cookie, else
   `Authorization: Bearer`, verifies it (ES256, `iss`, `aud` = `CLIENT_ID`, `exp`, `typ = access`), then
   re-reads `users.is_active` on **every** request (inactive / deleted → 401, DB error → 500). It sets
   `user_id` and `user_role` in the gin context, and the caller on the request context
   (`requestuser.With`) so logs written with `c.Request.Context()` carry `user_id`. `RequireRole(enum.RoleAdmin)` gates a group by role (no admin group is mounted yet).
3. The handler parses the query with `handlerutil.ParseQuery(c, type, spec)` **first** (before any side
   effect), binds the request document with `handlerutil.BindResource(c, ResourceSpec{Type, ID}, &req)`,
   calls the service, and writes with `handlerutil.WriteData` (or `WriteMeta` / `c.Status(204)`).
4. The service returns `*apperror.AppError` for anything the client should see; any other error becomes a
   500 in `handlerutil.WriteError`. `jsonapi.WriteErrorsContext(ctx, w, ...)` logs the wrapped cause with
   `status`, `code`, `err`: `request rejected` (warn, 4xx), `request failed` (error, 5xx), or `request
   cancelled` (warn) for a 5xx whose ctx is cancelled or whose chain holds `context.Canceled` — the ctx is the
   real signal, since lib/pq reports a cancelled query as a Postgres error. `context.DeadlineExceeded` stays an
   error (our timeout). `request_id` comes from ctx, else from the response header. `WriteErrors` is the
   `context.Background()` variant. `AppError.Unwrap()` returns `Err`, so `errors.Is` sees through it; the cause
   never reaches the response body.

### Logging

- `log/slog` only. `logging.Setup(conf.LogFormat, conf.LogLevel)` in `main` makes the default logger (stdout;
  `LOG_FORMAT` text / json, `LOG_LEVEL`); its handler adds `request_id` (`requestid.FromContext`) and the
  caller's `user_id` (`requestuser.FromContext`) to every record; both also read a `*gin.Context` (services get
  one as their ctx).
- **Use the `*Context` variant whenever a ctx is in scope** — that's where `request_id` comes from. Short
  lowercase message + key/value attributes, never a formatted string:
  `slog.ErrorContext(ctx, "notify: get note failed", "note_id", id, "err", err)`. **`user_id` always means the
  caller and comes from ctx** — never add it by hand on the request path; name another user for what it is
  (`target_user_id`, `recipient_id`). Background workers use `worker run failed` / `worker job failed` /
  `worker stopped` with a `worker` attribute, and (no request ctx) may log `user_id` for the user they process.
- Writing an error from a handler / middleware: pass the **request's** context —
  `jsonapi.WriteErrorsContext(handlerutil.RequestContext(c), c.Writer, ...)` (`handlerutil.WriteError`,
  `ParseQuery`, `ParamID` and `AccessTokenMiddleware` do). Not the `*gin.Context`: its `Err()` is always nil, so
  a cancellation would read as a server error. `RequestContext` falls back to `context.Background()` when
  `c.Request` is nil (`gin.CreateTestContext`).
- Startup failures: `logging.Fatal("load config failed", "err", err)`. A `TestMain` may use `log.Fatalf`.
- A goroutine that outlives the request: `utility.SafeGoContext(requestid.Detach(ctx), fn)` — `Detach` keeps
  the request id and the caller, so its logs (and a recovered panic) carry both. **Never `context.WithoutCancel(c)` on a `*gin.Context`**: gin reuses it for the next
  request. Anything async (an emailer, …) takes a ctx for the same reason.
- Tests that assert on logs swap the default: `prev := slog.Default(); slog.SetDefault(l); defer
  slog.SetDefault(prev)` with `l, _ := logging.New(&buf, logging.FormatJSON, "debug")`.

### Auth

- Register takes a `users` document; role is always `user` (a `role` attribute is a 403); email unique
  ignoring case (`users_email_lower_key`, pq `23505` → 409). 201 with the account, no `Location` (a plain user
  has no URL of its own).
- Login takes a `sessions` document (`email`, `password`). One 401 message for unknown email and wrong
  password; "no longer active" only after the password matched. Sets `app-access-token` (path `/`) and
  `app-refresh-token` (path `/api/auth`) HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookies (`COOKIE_SECURE`, `COOKIE_DOMAIN`), and
  answers with the account as `data` and the tokens under `meta` for non-browser clients.
- Tokens carry `typ` (`access` / `refresh`); each verify rejects the other type.
- **Refresh tokens rotate** (migration 000003, table `refresh_tokens`, one row per refresh token keyed on its
  `jti`). Login starts a *family* (one per login / device). `POST /api/auth/refresh` locks the presented token's
  row, issues a **new pair** (both cookies replaced, both tokens in `meta`), inserts the successor in the same
  family and marks the old one `revoked_at` + `replaced_by`. The new refresh token lives
  `REFRESH_TOKEN_DURATION` (optional, default 7 days) from now, so it's an idle timeout: a user who keeps
  coming back is never logged out; one who's away longer logs in again.
- **Trusted vs untrusted device** (`refresh_tokens.session_expires_at`): login's optional `trust_device` attribute. Trusted →
  `refresh_tokens.session_expires_at` NULL, the session slides with no cap. Untrusted (the default) →
  `session_expires_at = login + UNTRUSTED_SESSION_DURATION` (optional, default 7 days), copied to every
  successor; refresh issues a token no longer than what's left and is a 401 past it.
- **Reuse detection**: a spent token presented again revokes its whole family (→ 401), since it was probably
  stolen. Exception: within `reuseGrace` (10s, `refresh/service.go`) of its rotation it's treated as two tabs
  refreshing at once — 401, family kept. Clients should still single-flight their refresh calls.
- Refresh re-reads the user, so the new access token carries the **current** role and a deactivated user gets
  none. An unknown jti (no row) is a 401.
- Refresh / logout take the token from the cookie, else an optional `sessions` document
  (`{"data":{"type":"sessions","attributes":{"refresh_token":"..."}}}`). Refresh answers with a meta-only
  document.
- Logout revokes the presented token's family and clears the cookies; a missing / invalid token is still a
  204. The access token is a stateless JWT and stays valid until it
  expires — keep `ACCESS_TOKEN_DURATION` short.

### JSON:API

The whole API is JSON:API 1.1; keep it that way in a new slice.

- **Media type** (`middleware.JSONAPIMediaType`, on `/api`): a request body must be
  `Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json` with no parameter but `profile` (else 415); an `Accept` that lists the
  JSON:API type only with other parameters is a 406. No extensions are supported. Every response has
  `Vary: Accept`. `/healthz` sits outside `/api`.
- **Request documents** (`handlerutil.BindResource` → `DecodeResource`): `{"data": {"type", "id"?,
  "attributes"}}`; the attributes decode into the slice's `Request` and are validated with gin binding tags.
  No `data` / not one object → 400; wrong `type` → 409; an `id` on a create (client-generated) → 403; on an
  update the `id` is required and must equal the URL's (else 409); any `relationships` → 403; an attribute the
  `Request` doesn't declare (read-only, unknown) → 403; a wrong JSON type → 422; a failed rule → 422 per field.
  Every error carries `source.pointer` (`/data/attributes/title`).
- **Updates are `PATCH` and partial**: `Request` fields are pointers, nil keeps the current value (in SQL:
  `COALESCE(sqlc.narg(...), col)`; with nothing to change, just read the resource back).
- **Query parameters** (`handlerutil.ParseQuery` with the endpoint's `jsonapi.QuerySpec`): `include` (an
  `IncludeConfig{Allowed, Default}`, opt-in with a server default — never hardcode a policy), `fields[TYPE]`
  (sparse fieldsets; `Fields` maps each type the response carries to its resource struct), `sort` (one field,
  `-` for descending, from `SortConfig.Allowed`; the SQL orders with a `CASE` per value), `page[number]` /
  `page[size]`, `filter[NAME]` (`Filters`). Whatever the spec leaves out is a 400 with `source.parameter`, and
  so is any other all-lowercase name (reserved by the spec); names with a non a-z character are
  implementation-specific and ignored. An endpoint with no parameters still calls `ParseQuery` with an empty
  spec (delete, refresh, logout).
- **Responses** (`jsonapi.WriteData` via `handlerutil.WriteData`): `jsonapi.version`, `data`, `included`
  (each related resource once, never one that's also primary data), `meta`, `links.self`; a
  `pagination.Meta` meta adds `first` / `last` / `prev` / `next` (`null` when unavailable). Struct tags drive
  serialization: `jsonapi:"id"`, `json:"name"` for an attribute, `jsonapi:"relation,<name>,<type>"` for a
  relationship (nil pointer → `data: null`, slice → to-many). A create is 201 with a `Location` header; a
  delete / logout 204 with no body.
- **Costly relationships** (to-many, big tables): `include` / `fields` only trim at serialization, so pass
  the `Query` (or two bools) to the service and load by need — `q.Includes("path")` → full rows;
  else `q.WantsField(type, "rel")` → ids only (linkage); else skip it. Never render an empty to-many to mean
  "not loaded". A cheap to-one (e.g. `created_by` via JOIN) just always loads.
- **Errors**: `{"jsonapi", "errors": [{status, code, title, detail, source}]}`; several errors take their
  shared status, else 400 (all 4xx) / 500. Unknown routes (404), a wrong method (405) and panics (500) are
  JSON:API errors too (`router.go`). A non-numeric path id is a 404 (it names no resource).

### Config

`config.LoadConfig(".")` reads `.env` (optional) then OS env; `Validate()` requires every field except the
optional `REFRESH_TOKEN_DURATION` (default `168h`), `UNTRUSTED_SESSION_DURATION` (default `168h`), `COOKIE_SECURE` (default `true`), `COOKIE_DOMAIN`,
`LOG_FORMAT` (default `text`; `json` in production) and `LOG_LEVEL` (default `info`) — the last two must still
be values `logging.Check` accepts. Durations are Go duration strings (`15m`).
See `.env.example`.

## Testing conventions

- `*_unit_test.go` → test names end `_U`; `*_integration_test.go` → `_I` and start with
  `if testing.Short() { t.Skip(...) }`.
- **Every test is table-driven** (`testCases` slice + loop with `t.Run`), `testify/require`, gomock.
- Integration tests use `testhelper.SeedUser` / `SeedRefreshToken`, `defer testhelper.Truncate(t, testDB)`
  per case, and read back with `testhelper.GetUser` / `GetRefreshToken`. Add new tables to `Truncate`.
- Mocks are committed; regenerate after changing an interface.

## Gotchas

- `.env` and `*.pem` are gitignored; never commit keys or secrets.
- `sqlc.yaml` has one block per slice with queries — a new one needs its entry, then `make sqlc`.
- `updated_at` is maintained by the `update_updated_at_column()` trigger on every table that has it.
- `refresh_tokens` grows by one row per refresh and nothing prunes it yet — that's experiment 1 above.
